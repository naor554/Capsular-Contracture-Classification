# Capsular Contracture Detection Model

## Introduction
Capsular contracture is a condition that can happen after breast implant surgery. It occurs when scar tissue around the implant becomes hard and tight. This can cause pain, discomfort, or changes in how the breast looks or feels. Early detection of this problem can help doctors treat it faster and avoid complications.

## Problem
Doctors usually look at 3D medical images, like MRI scans, to find signs of capsular contracture. However, analyzing these images takes time and can sometimes lead to mistakes. This project aims to use a machine learning model to help identify this condition quickly and accurately.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze 3D breast MRI scans in `.nii.gz` format.
- Detect if there is excess tissue (a sign of capsular contracture).
- Provide a tool to help doctors diagnose the condition more easily.
